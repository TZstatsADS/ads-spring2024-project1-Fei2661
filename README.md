Term: Spring 2024

+ Projec title: Sleep Patterns and Well-being
+ This project is conducted by [Fei Li]

+ Project summary: [Sleep, an indispensable physiological phenomenon, occupies nearly one-third of a human being's life. This significant portion underscores the profound impact that sleep quality has on our overall health and well-being. It is a crucial element in maintaining both physical and mental health, highlighting the vital role of sleep in every individual's life. After a day filled with activities and challenges, quality sleep becomes a sanctuary of rest and rejuvenation. But beyond mere rest, how does the quality of our sleep influence our happiness and sense of well-being? This question is not just academic, it resonates with the daily experiences of every person, reflecting a universal concern for health and happiness.] Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.
